Collections

All programming languages will have support for a range of common data structures. Unlike typical dynamic programming language, collections are implemented as a standard library in Java (as opposed to being built in). We will survey the major features of this library, focusing on the principle interfaces and implementations. There is considerable more to collections, which should be investigated independently.
